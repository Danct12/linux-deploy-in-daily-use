Day 1: June 22, 2018

The first day of Linux Deploy, after installed it at home, I went back home from school, instead of going back to home, I went to a shop stop to just use it.

The first day of using it, there was pretty much not ready setup yet. I have to install base-devel just to be able to compile stuffs.

I thought that I was be able to compile programs out of the box from AUR, but I was wrong, there was a error with fakeroot, which telling me that function is not implemented, turns out to be my kernel (that comes with RR 6) doesn't support the function that fakeroot uses.

With that being said, I gone plan B, fakeroot-tcp. This simulates fakeroot, which is a win win, but sadly I have to gone through modifications.

After done, I built the package and install, and there, I was able to compile stuffs from AUR just fine.

I compiled DockbarX and DockbarX plugin for XFCE, both going without any problem, but except that I have to edit PKGBUILD to support aarch64, which is my architecture that the phone is running on.

Second problem is, Midori doesn't work properly on this, it keeps crashing everytime I open a website, so I installed firefox and it works just fine.

Third problem is, my favorite text editor (NeoVim) doesn't exist on aarch64 for ARM, but I'm saving it for the another day.


Day 2: June 25, 2018

Back from the English school, here I am back again.

I compiled NeoVim, it was a very slow task due to makepkg running on one thread, I forgot to edit it.

Works fine, no issue.
