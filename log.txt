Day 1: June 22, 2018

The first day of Linux Deploy, after installed it at home, I went back home from school, instead of going back to home, I went to a shop stop to just use it.

The first day of using it, there was pretty much not ready setup yet. I have to install base-devel just to be able to compile stuffs.

I thought that I was be able to compile programs out of the box from AUR, but I was wrong, there was a error with fakeroot, which telling me that function is not implemented, turns out to be my kernel (that comes with RR 6) doesn't support the function that fakeroot uses.

With that being said, I gone plan B, fakeroot-tcp. This simulates fakeroot, which is a win win, but sadly I have to gone through modifications.

After done, I built the package and install, and there, I was able to compile stuffs from AUR just fine.

I compiled DockbarX and DockbarX plugin for XFCE, both going without any problem, but except that I have to edit PKGBUILD to support aarch64, which is my architecture that the phone is running on.

Second problem is, Midori doesn't work properly on this, it keeps crashing everytime I open a website, so I installed firefox and it works just fine.

Third problem is, my favorite text editor (NeoVim) doesn't exist on aarch64 for ARM, but I'm saving it for the another day.


Day 2: June 25, 2018

Back from the English school, here I am back again.

I compiled NeoVim, it was a very slow task due to makepkg running on one thread, I forgot to edit it.

Works fine, no issue.

Day 3: June 27, 2018

God dang it! How much I hate Android system, I cannot unbind the Super (Windows) key and the Alt key just to make applications use it, whenever I want to do alt tab in XServer XSDL, it'll keep going to the android recent menu.

But I have a fix for that, it's a temporary work around, i know it's dumb but it works. By editing /system/usr/kblayouts/Generic.kl, I bound the Windows key to Volume Up and the Alt key to Volume Down, then changing the settings inside Linux Deploy to bind both keys to them. Now I have a working Super and Alt key for me to use!

As because it worked, I installed i3-gaps to replace XFCE, and here I am!

I uninstalled Midori and Firefox because it was laggy and installed Chromium instead, the performance on Chromium is quite better than others.

I removed some unused packages just to save some spaces, it is amazing that a ton of spaces was used and left me with 3.5 GB, hopefully i'll extend that some time in the future.

I got dunst up and configured.

Just to entertain my self, I installed xbill (old X11 game) just to have some fun tapping bills, but also I got it to play soilitare! How cool is that! :D

End of the day, I think it's a decent netbook if you have rooted it and run Linux, I'd suggest you to have root and install Linux Deploy Arch, this might turn your phone into a decent 2 in 1 netbook that you can also call, sms, and be able to run linux applications too.

Day 4: June 28, 2018

I got the battery reporting system to work with i3status, the uevent file is located in /sys/class/power_supply/battery/uevent

Chromium on this phone doesn't play videos, it'll just show a few frames of it and then freezes. So a workaround is to use mpv + youtube-dl.

I just extended the disk image from 6.8 GB to 13 GB, I did this because the space was running out and I need more space on doing this experiment.

The next thing I should try to do is to get Wine/x86 on ARM, this way, I can play Windows XP Solitaire (my favorite actually), and might be able to install BonziBUDDY. It might be a fun thing to do, but will also be fun on getting it to work, the thing I have to do is to compile QEMU with NPTL patch.

I tried to emulate NES, SNES so I can play Super Mario World, but sadly the results aren't happy.

SNES9x is on Arch Linux ARM repo, but sadly it doesn't boot to any games, all it boot to was just a plain black screen, no error messages in the terminal, that's pretty much it, just a black screen.

higen cannot do SDL, when I launch it with video as SDL, it crashes.

mednafen crashes on startup.

Turns out it's not my fault but rather a problem with ARM processors, so the idea of playing Mario on a Linux phone is no more.

Day 5: (June 29, 2018)

I just installed SuperTux 2, it's the good game I have played on the phone, but also playable as well, it's quite fun, it runs at 60 fps.

I still haven't setup Wine on ARM yet, that's because I don't have time to compile it, it takes a whole load of time because of Linux Deploy runs on a core (even if it's chrooted), I have made a issue on meefik's github ( https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy/issues/973 )

The next thing I'll do is to setup VirtualGL (on my host computer), so I can run OpenGL applications, it might be a bit laggy but it's not going to be really bad (hopefully). :)
