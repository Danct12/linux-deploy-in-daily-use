Day 1: June 22, 2018

The first day of Linux Deploy, after installed it at home, I went back home from school, instead of going back to home, I went to a shop stop to just use it.

The first day of using it, there was pretty much not ready setup yet. I have to install base-devel just to be able to compile stuffs.

I thought that I was be able to compile programs out of the box from AUR, but I was wrong, there was a error with fakeroot, which telling me that function is not implemented, turns out to be my kernel (that comes with RR 6) doesn't support the function that fakeroot uses.

With that being said, I gone plan B, fakeroot-tcp. This simulates fakeroot, which is a win win, but sadly I have to gone through modifications.

After done, I built the package and install, and there, I was able to compile stuffs from AUR just fine.

I compiled DockbarX and DockbarX plugin for XFCE, both going without any problem, but except that I have to edit PKGBUILD to support aarch64, which is my architecture that the phone is running on.

Second problem is, Midori doesn't work properly on this, it keeps crashing everytime I open a website, so I installed firefox and it works just fine.

Third problem is, my favorite text editor (NeoVim) doesn't exist on aarch64 for ARM, but I'm saving it for the another day.


Day 2: June 25, 2018

Back from the English school, here I am back again.

I compiled NeoVim, it was a very slow task due to makepkg running on one thread, I forgot to edit it.

Works fine, no issue.

Day 3: June 27, 2018

God dang it! How much I hate Android system, I cannot unbind the Super (Windows) key and the Alt key just to make applications use it, whenever I want to do alt tab in XServer XSDL, it'll keep going to the android recent menu.

But I have a fix for that, it's a temporary work around, i know it's dumb but it works. By editing /system/usr/kblayouts/Generic.kl, I bound the Windows key to Volume Up and the Alt key to Volume Down, then changing the settings inside Linux Deploy to bind both keys to them. Now I have a working Super and Alt key for me to use!

As because it worked, I installed i3-gaps to replace XFCE, and here I am!

I uninstalled Midori and Firefox because it was laggy and installed Chromium instead, the performance on Chromium is quite better than others.

I removed some unused packages just to save some spaces, it is amazing that a ton of spaces was used and left me with 3.5 GB, hopefully i'll extend that some time in the future.

I got dunst up and configured.

Just to entertain my self, I installed xbill (old X11 game) just to have some fun tapping bills :)
