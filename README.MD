This is my own experiment on using [Linux Deploy by meefik](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy) as something like a portable laptop in everyday life.

The experiment is based on a Google video from 2008 featuring a guy typing on a flip phone that is shaped like a laptop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgsw-NgDoFE
