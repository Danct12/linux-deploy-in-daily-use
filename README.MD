# Linux Deploy in a daily life

This is my own experiment on using [Linux Deploy by meefik](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy) as something like a portable laptop in everyday life.

Linux Deploy settings:
- Distro: **Arch Linux ARM**
- Architecture: aarch64 (arm64)
- HDD Size: 13870 MB
- Desktop: i3-gaps
- Graphics Mode used: [XServer XSDL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server)
