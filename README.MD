# Linux Deploy in a daily life

**UNLOCKING BOOTLOADER, ROOT, MODDING YOUR DEVICE WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY, AND MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRICK DEVICE (in both soft and hard), DO NOT MAKE ANY ISSUE THAT MY EXPERIMENT BRICKED YOUR PHONE OR DOING FUNKY STUFFS ON YOUR PHONE. IT'LL BE A MATERIAL FOR ME TO LAUGH AT.**
